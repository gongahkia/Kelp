## Deployment 

| Platform | Status | Download |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Windows | Up | On WSL, below instructions |
| MacOS | Up | Below instructions |
| Linux | Up | Below instructions |

## Installation and usage

1. Run the following commands in your terminal.

> To continue from here, adding instructions to curl the installation file and run ti

```console
$ 
$ chmod +x installer.sh
$ ./installer.sh
```

2. After running the Rust installer, we have to add a line of code to the **bottom** of our `.bashrc` file to indicate the file path. *(Neovim is used below, but it can be replaced with any other code editor)*.

```console
$ nvim ~/.bashrc
```

*Line to be added:* 

```bash
export PATH=~/.config/Kelp-build:$PATH
```

---

## Uninstalling Kelp

```console
$ cd ~/.config
$ rm -r Kelp-build
```

Additionally, remember to remove the line added to your `.bashrc` file. 

```console
$ nvim ~/.bashrc
-- removes final line from file
```
