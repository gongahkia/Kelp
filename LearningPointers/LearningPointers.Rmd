# Main learning pointers

1. Always remember to use `.trim_end()` when dealing with user input, since a *newline character* (`\n`) is appended to user input when the **carriage return** (enter key) character is hit.
   * This tip alone will save you hours of time debugging when working with simple user input.

2. Learn more about *iterator statements* in Rust, such as the `.iter()`, `.map()`, `.collect()` statements.
   * As an example, I made use of the .chars(), .all() operator to powerfully check whether multiple items satisfied a predicate.

3. In the future, start out by planning my program with Rust's modules in mind, to allow for easier **refactoring** in the future.

```{rust}
fn main() {
    println!("I am losing my mind");
}
```
